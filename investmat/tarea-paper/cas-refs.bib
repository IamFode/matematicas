abstract = {Central banks have different objectives in the short and long run. Governments operate simultaneously at different timescales. Many economic processes are the result of the actions of several agents, who have different term objectives. Therefore, a macroeconomic time series is a combination of components operating on different frequencies. Several questions about economic time series are connected to the understanding of the behavior of key variables at different frequencies over time, but this type of information is difficult to uncover using pure time-domain or pure frequency-domain methods. To our knowledge, for the first time in an economic setup, we use cross-wavelet tools to show that the relation between monetary policy variables and macroeconomic variables has changed and evolved with time. These changes are not homogeneous across the different frequencies.},

As a generalization of these latter approaches, in this work we allow the long-memory parameter d to be varying over time. We adopt a semi-parametric approach in order to avoid fitting a time-varying parametric model, such as tvARFIMA, to the observed data. We study the asymptotic behavior of a local log-regression wavelet estimator of the time-dependent d. Both simulations and a real data example complete our work on providing a fairly general approach.}

Since macroeconomic data frequently contains these characteristics, wavelets appear to be a natural tool for studying macroeconomic time series. This paper first describes wavelets in an intuitive manner, and then explores their use on macroeconomic data. Initial results are encouraging and more research is in order.},

One such representation was introduced by D. Gabor in 1946 into signal analysis; it is based on the consideration of a family of “elementary wavelets” that can be obtained from one “basic wavelet” by shifts in time and in frequency. We present here a different representation, in which frequency shifts are replaced by dilations. The resulting “voice transform” and “cycle-octave transform” are briefly described from the mathematical point of view and illustrated by numerical examples.}

In this way, one can characterize how international stock returns relate in the time and frequency domains simultaneously, which allows one to provide a richer analysis of the comovement. We focus on Germany, Japan, UK and US and the analysis is done at both the aggregate and sectoral levels.}

In this article we apply wavelet analysis to one of the most investigated relationships is in empirical macroeconomics: the relationship between wage inflation and unemployment. Using US postwar data we find a frequency-dependent relationship of a sort that is consistent with Phillips’ original insights. It also turns out that this relationship is remarkably stable over the 1948–93 period, but not in the aftermath, as a consequence of a process of adaption of the wage formation process to a low inflation environment.},

Impulse response functions are also utilized to examine the signs of how one of these variables affects the other over time. One key empirical finding from the causality tests is that there is strengthening evidence of the nominal interest rate differential Granger causing the exchange rate as the wavelet time scale increases. When considering impulse responses on how the interest rate differential affects the exchange rate, there appears to be some evidence of more negative relationships at the shorter time scales (i.e. an increase in the Swedish interest rate compared to that of another country is associated with a lower Swedish krona price of the other country's currency) and more positive relationships at the longer time scales.}

Wavelet decomposition of the original time series is useful in characterizing the oil–stock price relationship at different time scales, in revealing contagion and interdependence between oil and stock prices (as in the recent global financial crisis) and in analysing oil lead and lag effects on stock prices through wavelet cross-correlation. Empirical evidence for the period June 2000 to July 2011 indicates that oil price changes had no effect on stock market returns in the pre-crisis period at either the aggregate or sectoral level (with the exception of oil and gas company stock). At both levels, however, with the onset of the financial crisis we found evidence of contagion and positive interdependence between these markets. Additionally, we found no evidence of lead and lag effects in the pre-crisis period, and so reject the underreaction hypothesis. Since the onset of the financial crisis, oil price leads stock prices and vice versa for higher frequencies, whereas for lower frequencies oil and stock prices lead each other in a complex way.}

The latter technique has the advantage over the former technique in that it can deal with possible specification biases and spurious relationships that may have arisen from structural changes. The empirical results from the VEC method reveal a bidirectional causal relationship between money and prices. The results from the TVC technique suggest that money is acting as an exogenous process determining the price level.}

I find that the long-run relationship between money growth and inflation is strong in a statistical sense and important economically.

abstract = {Abstract Using a sample of about 160 countries over the last 30 years, we test for the quantity theory relationship between money and inflation. When analysing the full sample of countries, we find a strong positive relation between long-run inflation and the money growth rate. The relation is not proportional, however. The strong link between inflation and money growth is almost wholly due to the presence of high-(or hyper-) inflation countries in the sample. The relationship between inflation and money growth for low-inflation countries (on average less than 10\% per annum over the last 30 years) is weak.},
